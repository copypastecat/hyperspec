# Optimal Frequency Sampling for Detection in Multi-Spectral Images
Simulation framework for sampled multi-spectral images. See the [pre-print](https://github.com/copypastecat/hyperspec/blob/main/freqsampling_paper.pdf) for detailed information about method and the theory behind it.
This framework is not actively maintained. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me. Contact information can be found [here](https://www.kth.se/profile/lgrosse).
